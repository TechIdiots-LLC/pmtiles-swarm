# pmtiles-swarm changelog

## master
### ✨ Features and improvements
- **Serve tiles.** Every archive now has a TileJSON endpoint and a `{z}/{x}/{y}` tile endpoint
  under `/archives/{infohash}/`. A node holding a complete copy reads its local file; a node in
  cache mode reads through the swarm via `pmtiles-torrent`, fetching only the pieces a requested
  tile lives in and seeding them back.
- The TileJSON carries a non-standard `torrent` block — infohash, magnet, `.torrent` URL, web
  seeds and any BEP 46 publisher key. Ordinary clients ignore it and fetch over HTTP;
  torrent-aware clients use it to join the swarm directly. One URL serves both.
- Tiles are served `immutable` with a year-long max-age. An infohash pins content, so a tile
  under one can never change, and an updated archive gets new URLs rather than needing a purge.
- New `trustProxy` config option. With it set, absolute URLs in TileJSON and the RSS feed are
  derived per request from `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host`, so one node can answer
  correctly on both `https://public` and `http://internal`.
- Depend on `pmtiles-torrent` from npm, and drop the local copy of the libtorrent sidecar in
  favour of the one it ships. The two copies had drifted: the read side had grown `info` and
  `set_priority` ops this project never got, which are exactly what on-demand tile reads need.
- Upgrade WebTorrent to 3.x, dropping the `uint8-util` override that the 2.x line needed to add
  magnets at all. **Node 20 is no longer supported** — WebTorrent 3 requires Node 22+, and Node
  20 reached end of life in April 2026.

### 🐞 Bug fixes
- Absolute URLs used the raw `Host` header, which behind a reverse proxy is the internal address
  the proxy dialled. They now follow `X-Forwarded-Host` when a proxy is trusted, so published
  tile and feed URLs are reachable.
- Stop tracking a compiled `.pyc` that predated the `__pycache__` ignore rule.

## 0.1.0
### ✨ Features and improvements
- Initial release: BitTorrent distribution for PMTiles map archives.
- Pluggable seeding engines: libtorrent (via sidecar), qBittorrent (WebUI API), and embedded WebTorrent.
- Four ways to add an archive: local file, remote URL, existing torrent or magnet, and adoption of what the engine already seeds.
- Web seeds (BEP 19) registered automatically, so a new archive is usable before it has any peers.
- Mirror and cache modes; joining defaults to cache so a large archive cannot silently claim the disk.
- Scheduled sources for upstreams publishing a new dated URL per build.
- Origin change detection, with optional guarded auto-rebuild.
- RSS publish and subscribe, with map metadata (format, zoom range, bounds) in each item.
- Hybrid v1+v2 torrent creation through libtorrent.
- BEP 46 mutable-torrent helpers.
