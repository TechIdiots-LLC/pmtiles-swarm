## 0.1.0
### ✨ Features and improvements
- Initial release: BitTorrent distribution for PMTiles map archives.
- Pluggable seeding engines: libtorrent (via sidecar), qBittorrent (WebUI API), and embedded WebTorrent.
- Four ways to add an archive: local file, remote URL, existing torrent or magnet, and adoption of what the engine already seeds.
- Web seeds (BEP 19) registered automatically, so a new archive is usable before it has any peers.
- Mirror and cache modes; joining defaults to cache so a large archive cannot silently claim the disk.
- Scheduled sources for upstreams publishing a new dated URL per build.
- Origin change detection, with optional guarded auto-rebuild.
- RSS publish and subscribe, with map metadata (format, zoom range, bounds) in each item.
- Hybrid v1+v2 torrent creation through libtorrent.
- BEP 46 mutable-torrent helpers.
